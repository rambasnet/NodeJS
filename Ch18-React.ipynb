    "- `component-based` UI makes it easier to compose and manage complex UIs with their own state (data)\n",
    "    - since component logic is written in JS, instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM\n",
    "- `learn once, write anywhere` feature doesn't make any assumptions about the technology stack\n",
