    "## Synchronous Programming\n",
    "- synchronous execution usually refers to code executing in sequence\n",
    "- program is executed line by line top to bottom one statement at a time\n",
    "- when a function is called, the caller waits until the callee returns and the caller continues to the next line of code\n",
    "- these operations may also be called **blocking** as they preven further execution until that operation is complete\n",
    "- most programming languages by default do synchronous execution\n",
    "- all operations are blocking and execute in sync\n",
    "- may not be greate experience for end users as they wait seeing rainbow-colored cursor (or beachball)\n",
    "- also not effecient utilization of many cores modern computers typically have\n",

    "## Asynchronous Programming\n",
    "- asynchronous execution refers to execution that doesn't follow the sequence it appears in the code\n",
    "- program doesn't wait for current task to complete and can move on to the next statement\n",
    "- when a async operation/code is executed, execution cotinues without **blocking** the next statement/code that need to be executed\n",
    "- order of the operations can't be predicted before hand as the code execute asynchronously\n",
    "- generally speaking most operations that are usually slow such as **I/O** and **time** related operations are aync or blocking"
