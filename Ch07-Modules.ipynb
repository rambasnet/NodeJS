    "- Start by moving repeatedly used code into a function\n",

    "- A good module is small and focuses on one problem\n",
    "- Individual files in a module should not be longer than around 150 lines of JavaScript\n",
    "- A module shouldn't have more than one level of nested folders full of JavaScript files. If it does, it is probably doing too many things\n",
    "- If it takes more than a few minutes to understand what is happening, it probably isn't a very good module."
